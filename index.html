        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> Hello, my students call me Mr. Dou. I am a math and coding teacher at AUPE in Bushwick. I like to read and write, and I watch a lot of Youtube and read fantasy novels in my free time. I am always tired because I don't get enough exercise or sleep, but I like to ride my bike and do Tai Chi. My dream job would be to teach philosophy. </p>

        <h2>What is Philosophy? Click to learn more</h2>
        <p>
            Philosophy is all about reading books to learn about how people in the past thought, how to learn from them to become a better person, and how to learn how to think for yourself.
